surely life will be different but how
what types of houses will people live in
will everybody have a personal robot to help with tedious chores
will advanced telecommunications systems make going to school or to the office a thing of the past
whatever the changes may be it is safe to predict that mathematics will continue to play an important role in almost every aspect of daily life
and even if calculators and computers are commonplace you will still need to know the best ways to use these tools to solve increasingly complex problems
for you to be prepared for the st century learning mathematics means learning to think mathematically to recognize patterns and relationships to find alternative or simpler ways to answer questions to be flexible in your approach to a problem even letting it lead you in different directions that might produce exciting results
this first chapter offers a variety of activities that will start you thinking mathematically
you may find that the most challenging problems are also the most fun
alan hoffer martin johnson richard lodhaly larg a messert stary stave leinwand tina thoburn thinking mathematically what dreams are made of e
o applying mathematics last week you won tax free in the usa lottery
after looking in stores and reading lots of advertisements you made a list of things you might like to buy for yourself and your family
i ili ni large screen tv stereo system sailboat new wardrobe speed bicycle round the world tour computer laser printer camcorder sports car motor home
how much money do you need to buy everything on your list
what items would you buy
try to get as close to as you can without going over
use a calculator to help you solve the problem
suppose you want to donate to the save the whales fund and put to of the money that remains into a savings account
a
how much money will you save
b
how much money will you have left to spend
estimate
do you think you can buy everything on your list
o mathematically thinking et mm
if you buy the large screen television the stereo system the computer and printer and the camcorder all at ed s electronics you get a s discount off the total cost
a
how much money will you save with the discount
b
how much will you spend
there are four other members of your family besides yourself your mother and father your year old brother and your year old sister
the travel agent tells you that children under years can travel for half price
a
do you have enough money for the whole family to go on the round theworld vacation
explain
b
if so do you have enough money left over to buy a new wardrobe
if you take all year to spend the money how much can you spend monthly if you spend the same amount each month
each day
use year days
pretend you have the
look at advertisements or visit some stores
make up a list of things you would buy and how much all the items will cost
decide if you want to spend all or only part of your money
get together with some other students to compare lists and discuss your plans
if you spend all the money in one week how much can you spend daily if you spend the same amount each day
thinking mathematically not visual reasoning a
suppose you had small wooden cubes that you put together to form a large by by cube
you paint all the faces of the large cube red as shown
after the paint dries you take the large cube apart
you are surprised to find that not all the little cubes look the same
all cubes a painted equally are c
some of the little cubes have red faces
from where on the large cube did these cubes come
how many of these cubes are there
other little cubes have exactly red faces
make a sketch to show where these cubes were located on the original cube
how many are there
there are several cubes that have exactly red face
make a sketch to show where these were located
how many are there
are there any cubes that have no red faces
how many
are there any cubes that have faces
red
check to see that you have accounted for all little cubes
je sb b
try answering questions like the ones on page for a by by cube and a by by cube
make a table like the one below and complete it
sketch the cubes to help you
mathematically thinking number of cubes with painted faces cube size by by by by by bya
what patterns can you find in your table
hint recall the number of faces edges and corners on a cube and where each type of little cube is located
can you predict the numbers of differently painted little cubes in a by by cube
how about a by by cube
try making up some cube problems of your own
for variation begin with a large cube that only has some of its faces painted and explore how the little cubes look
thinking mathematically puzzle card a xo if they
number fits puzzle card b use it x puzzle card c io in co using number concepts a
to solve the number puzzles on this page it will help you to have a set of digit slips
cut out ten slips each about the size of a postage stamp
write each of the digits once on the paper slips
there are four puzzle cards a d each card has four multiplication problems on it
to solve each puzzle you must place the digits so that all the multiplication problems are correct at the same time
remember you must use each digit exactly once on a card
puzzle card d make a larger copy of each card
then use your digit slips moving them around until you find an arrangement that works
be sure to record your solutions
b
now create some puzzle cards of your own
then exchange cards with a partner and solve each other s puzzle
sering up yummy burgers billion sold mathematically thinking measuring yummy burgers has been selling its product worldwide for the last years
as you can see from the sign the company is very successful
there are three kinds of burgers yums pound double yums a pound super yums i pound use a calculator to help you solve the problem
if yummy burgers sold an equal number of each kind of burger how many of each kind were sold
how many pounds of each kind were sold
how many pounds in all were sold
the average burger is a inch square
if the billion burgers were lined up side by side how many feet long would the line be
the moon is about miles from earth
could yummy burgers advertise that it has sold enough burgers to make a stack that reaches the moon
if not what could yummy burgers truthfully say
the circumference of the earth at the equator is about miles
about how many times would the line of burgers go around the equator
suppose that a hamburger roll is made with ounces of flour and flour comes in pound sacks
about how many sacks of flour were needed to bake all the rolls
the average height of a burger is inch
how many feet high would a stack of billion burgers be
make up some problems of your own about yummy burgers
or create some new data to use
think french fries
thinking mathematically three sums two sums using number concepts a
look at the following sequences
what is true about the numbers in each sequence
give two other sequences with the same property now think about the number
how can you express as the sum of two consecutive numbers
how can you find another way to express as a sum of consecutive numbers
how many numbers did you use
can you express as the sum of four consecutive numbers
if yes show how
del as you just saw can be expressed as the sum of consecutive numbers in different ways
do some investigating
find ways to express the numbers from to as sums of consecutive numbers
look for ways using two three or four consecutive numbers
make a chart like the one below and use it to record your work
number sum of two consecutive numbers sum of three consecutive numbers sum of four consecutive numbers o awn ven four sums o b
look for patterns in your chart
think about ways to summarize what you have discovered
for which nurnbers was it impossible to find any sum
one of these numbers can be expressed as the sum of five consecutive numbers
which number is it
how can you describe the other numbers
which number do you think comes next in the list of impossible numbers
mathematically thinking
how would you complete these statements
every number greater than can be expressed as the sum of two consecutive numbers
l no number can be expressed as the sum of two consecutive numbers
describe the numbers that could be expressed as the sum of three consecutive numbers
can you predict what the next number with this property is
do you see a relationship between the number being expressed and the middle number of the sums
describe the numbers that could be expressed as the sum of four consecutive numbers
what are the next two numbers with this property
can you predict which ways can be written
what about and
check your answers by writing the sums
try writing sums of five six seven or more consecutive numbers for the numbers to
look for general patterns
study the numbers that make up the sums and relate them to the number being expressed vie thinking mathematically working on the railroad logical reasoning a the efficient switching of railroad cars creates some interesting problems
look at the picture at the right
there is a circular track and two side tracks
the tunnel is wide enough for the locomotive but it is not wide enough for either car
either end of the locomotive can be used for pushing or pulling the cars together or separately
here is the problem using the locomotive switch the positions of b cars a and b and return the locomotive to its original spot
find a sequence of steps to accomplish the switch
a step is any movement of the locomotive between stops assuming it stops when it reverses direction or hooks or unhooks from a car
it may help for you to copy the diagram and use slips of paper labeled a b and l to represent the cars and the locomotive
be sure to record each step
the best solution is the one that uses the fewest number of steps
compare the solution you found with the solutions of some other students
was there a shorter solution
make up some other switching problems of your own using the same original positions for the cars and locomotive
see who can find the best solution
are there any problems that seem impossible

extra practice page understanding numbers and interpreting data understanding a concept organizing data in tables farm economist mario torres has collected data on grain production in his state for the year just ended
barley bushels corn bushels millet bushels oats bushels rye bushels wheat bushels grain production grain number of bushels mario wants to organize the data in a table for publication
he begins by organizing the data from greatest to least and presenting it in two different tables
the first shown here gives exact production quantities
he wants a second table to give production quantities in thousands of bushels
how can he do this
when exact figures are not needed you can use rounding to represent data in a table
corn wheat oats barley rye millet step step step round data to the nearest thousand
think of each number as a number of thousands
organize the data as desired and enter it in a table
grain production grain number of bushels in thousands corn wheat oats barley rye millet
which table should mario use for publication
why
is there another way he could have chosen to present the data
how
how could mario have shown the data in a table based on quantities of ten thousand bushels
would it make sense to choose to express the data in hundred millions
why or why not
when are exact figures not important in a table
give examples
lesson try out write the letter of the correct answer
a table shows data in measurements of hundred thousand bushels
how would the number appear in the table

write the number as it would appear in a table using the unit of measurement for the data
in thousands of barrels
in millions of barrels
in ten thousands of barrels
in ten millions of barrels
in ten billions of barrels
in trillions of barrels a table shows data in ten thousand dollar amounts
write the amount as it would appear in the table
the number tells how the quantity has been entered in a table
tell how the numbers in the table are presented

in which years would the speeds have been the same if the times were rounded to the nearest miles per hour
you can use a five step process to solve this problem
average speed in miles per hour understand what do i know
i know the winning speed in each of five years to the nearest tenth
what do i need to find
i need to find the years in which the speeds rounded to the nearest whole number are equal
plan what can i do
i can round the speeds to the nearest miles per hour compare the rounded speeds to find those that are the same and record my results
try let me try my plan
i can round the average speed of to to to to and to
the years in which the average speeds are the same are and
check have i answered the question
yes
i rounded correctly and compared all the rounded speeds
extend what have i learned
i can read and interpret tables to solve problems
rounding numbers means you lose some accuracy
i may have to use tenths hundredths or thousandths to record speeds accurately
how can i apply what i have learned
lesson practice race drivers driver use the five step process to solve

applying operations whole numbers and decimals c urriculum n n n e cilo math and music in recent years the compact disc cd has become available for people who want to listen to popular and classical music
before the cd the long playing record lp had been the usual form in which people purchased recorded music
cds have solved some problems that lps have
an lp can be easily scratched
with repeated playing the grooves of the record wear down which affects the quality of the sound heard
lps are bulkier and less portable than cds
the sound on an lp is etched in a long continuous groove
to play an lp the needle starts at the outermost part of the groove and moves toward the center as the record turns on a turntable
the record is designed to play at a constant speed of revolutions per minute
therefore the stylus or needle travels much faster in the outer grooves than it does when it reaches the inner groovesfrom about inches per second down to about inches per second
to allow for this difference more information must be packed into the inner grooves
this can result in a loss of sound quality
what if a song on an lp lasted for minutes
about how many revolutions would the turntable make
think an lp makes revolutions per minute
round to and multiply by the number of minutes
a x for a minute song the turntable would make about revolutions
activities

thus one horsepower hp became the standard unit of power equal to foot pounds per second
power is represented as the ratio of the work to be done and the time needed to do the work
the formula is power work time what if a engine airplane has hp per engine
how many pounds could this engine plane lift one foot in one minute
find the amount of work
think x hp hp hp pounds per minute hp x pounds per minute pounds per minute a engine plane that has hp per engine can lift pounds per minute
activities

a standard calculator uses an arithmetic operating system
it performs operations in the order in which they are entered
a scientific calculator has an algebraic operating system
it performs operations according to the correct order of operations
one way to perform operations in the correct order using a standard calculator is to use the calculator s memory keys

now known as the rhind papyrus it is thought to have been written in egypt during the seventeenth century b c
the rhind papyrus is an important source of information about egyptian mathematics
it contains solved problems showing the equations
there are some strange ideas
for example the early egyptians used only unit fractions except for which had a special symbol
unit fractions are fractions with the number in the numerator
for example the early egyptians would have expressed the fraction as the sum of these unit fractions
lazio a the first addend is the largest unit fraction less than the given fraction that has a denominator that is a divisor of the original denominator
the second addend is the next largest such fraction
the addends continue to decrease in value until the sum is equal to what if you want to express the fraction using the ancient egyptian system

objects in the distance seem to float above objects close up
these artists did not use the concept of perspective which comes from the latin word for seen through in a picture with perspective objects in the distance appear smaller as they do in the real world
lines that are parallel such as railroad tracks appear to come together in the distance until they meet at a point called the vanishing point
use of perspective makes pictures look like the real world

it involved a glass plate held vertically on a stand

ratio proportion and percent c urriculum e c ct math and music the greek mathematician pythagoras b c
discovered the reason some combinations of musical tones are pleasing to the ear
they have particular mathematical relationships with each other
pythagoras found that the pitch of the note made by plucking a stretched string varied according to the string s length
he discovered that the shorter the string the faster the vibrations and the higher the pitch
pythagoras worked out a ratio between the tone produced by the full length string used as the first note of a scale and every other note in the scale
one pleasing combination of tones is a major chord which is made of the st rd th and th notes of a scale
look at the following table
it gives the notes and the frequency number per second of vibrations producing each note of a major chord beginning on g note of scale root st octave th rd th tone g b d g frequency what if you want to know the relationship of the frequencies of each note in the major chord to the root
find the ratio of the other notes to the root
think the ratio of the rd to the root is or in simplest form
the ratio of the th to the root is or
the ratio of the octave to the root is or
activities a a
make a one string instrument by first stretching a rubber band around a book
then place two pencils under the rubber band at each end of the book

measurement surface area and volume cha urriculum e cilon iii ii sun s rays no shadow math and geography a greek scholar eratosthenes c c b c
devised a method for calculating the circumference of the earth
he knew that the sun s rays are parallel when they strike the earth but due to the earth s curvature the rays hit at different angles
he knew that if he put sticks into the ground at right angles to the earth and imagined them as lines extended into the earth these lines would meet at the center of the earth
by using the distance between two points on earth and the angle the sun s rays made with sticks at these points he calculated the circumference of the earth
eratosthenes chose the cities of alexandria and syene as his points
he estimated the distance between the two cities as syene miles
he knew that when the sun was shadow directly overhead in syene a vertical rod of stick would not cast a shadow
at the same alexandria moment miles away in alexandria a vertical rod cast a shadow
eratosthenes measured the height of the stick and the length of the shadow to find the measurements of sides of a right a triangle
he completed the triangle and measured the angles
the angle where the stick and the third line met was about o
miles a l the sun s rays and the line of the stick at alexandria can be thought of as parallel lines and a transversal
since corresponding and vertical angles are congruent the central angle in the earth is also about o
a circle has so is about go of a circle
a what if you wanted to calculate the circumference of the earth
think the angle between the cities is of a circle
so the distance between the cities is of a circle
the circumference of the earth must be times the distance from alexandria to syene or miles
activities
find the actual measurement of the circumference of the earth
what might account for the error eratosthenes made

integers ch urriculum onnection math and art braiding is a weaving technique
the most familiar kind of braiding uses three strands and is used for braiding hair
braids can be worked into patterns to make belts straps ropes or decorative wall hangings
the peruvian zigzag braid uses a center yarn that is stationary it is not woven in
this stationary yarn may be thought of as the zero point
to begin there must be an even number of yarns on each side of the stationary yarn
each letter in the diagram represents a strand of yarn

it is woven over and under each of the other yarns until it falls at the other side
then yarn b is woven over and under until it falls at the other side
this is continued with each yarn until all yarns are to the right of the center yarn
then the process is reversed
as the weaver continues a zigzag pattern is formed
what if you think of the number of yarns on each side of the stationary yarn as negative and positive integers
what would a row indicated by the ordered pair look like
how many yarns must be used
think there must be an odd number of yarns with a center stationary yarn

a cereal manufacturer packs a photo of a national park inside each box
there are different photos in all and they are evenly distributed among the boxes
how many boxes would you expect to have to buy to get all photos
some probability problems are too difficult to solve directly or theoretically and so you can conduct an experiment to simulate the situation
simulations often use random numbers to estimate a probability
you can find random numbers by using a cube a spinner a computer or a random digits table
working together
you can use your number spinner to generate random digits to simulate the situation
let each of the digits through represent one of the photos
spin the spinner and record your result in a table
continue spinning until all digits have appeared
count and record the number of spins it took to get all digits
repeat the experiment times
calculate the average number of spins it took to get all digits
random digits generated by computer
you can also use a table of random digits to conduct an experiment
let each of the digits through represent one of the photos
begin in the upper lefthand corner of the table
count across the rows until all digits have appeared
record the number of digits it took to find all digits
repeat the experiment beginning where you left off each time until you can go no farther

they may say susie has grandmother s black hair or sam has uncle john s green eyes these physical traits are the result of heredity the passing of characteristics from one generation to another
heredity is understood because of the study of genetics a field of science begun in the nineteenth century by the austrian monk gregor mendel
mendel studied the effects of crossbreeding different kinds of peas
eye color is one trait that has been studied
each person carries two genes for eye color
the gene for dark eyes is stronger than the gene for light eyes
the diagrams below show the probability of the children of two sets of parents inheriting light or dark eyes

what is the probability that a child of theirs will have blue eyes

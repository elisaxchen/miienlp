# What does it do?

The purpose of this program is to calculate scores such as association and centeredness between different sets of words to approximate the relationships between those words. Currently, this program can run a group-to-domain test. For example, it can calculate the association between male (group) words with career (domain) words, the association between female (group) words with career (domain) words, and the gender centeredness of the career words.

After running those tests, this program can also clean and visualize the output of those tests.

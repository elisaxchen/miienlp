# WEAT
## WEAT metrics
The metrics specific to the WEAT tests are defined as follows:

Association: mean of all the pairwise cosine similarities between word embeddings from two sets of words. Sometimes referred to as the association/the cosine similarity between two sets of words.

Female or Male Association: If the domain is stated as X, then the female or male association is the association between female or male words and words of the X domain.

Gender Centeredness: female-domain association minus male-domain association. Might also be referred to as gender bias.

EWP: Percentage of WEAT test words that had a valid word embedding vector.

## WEAT modules

The file used for running WEAT analysis and cleaning (to prepare for visualizations) is main.py. There are three modules that WEAT analysis calls: fetchvec, wordtest, and utils. The WEAT cleaning module is: cleaning.

To run visualizations, you can run line_graphs_viz.R (line graphs) and bar_graphs_viz.R (for bar graphs).

### Fetchvec

Fetchvec looks at your input embeddings and extracts only the embeddings that will be needed to run the tests. These extracted embeddings are stored in a TEMP file (the location of the TEMP file is determined by the out_dir you specify in the YAML file - see the YAML file input descriptions for more details).

### Wordtest

Wordtest runs the actual calculations on the embeddings. The test we are currently using is called the T1 test, which measures male-domain and female-domain associations. For example, if the domain is 'science', we will get (1) the association (i.e. cosine similarity) between the word embeddings for male words and the word embeddings for science words, (2) the association between the word embeddings for female words and the word embeddings for science words, (3) the gender centerdness, which is female-science association minus male-science association, (4) the absolute value of the centeredness,  (5) the effective word percentage, which tells you how many of the words you were testing are actually in the data, and (6) statistics, like t-statistic, p-value, n1 (total # of pairwise cosine similarities calculated between group 1 and the domain), and n2 (total # of pairwise cosine similarities calculated between group 2 and the domain).

### Utils

Contains YAML file parsing functionality and includes helpers for loading tests, loading models, and calculating scores (e.g. association between two sets of words) needed in the Wordtest module.

## Cleaning

Cleans up JSON files that were output by WEAT analysis. It converts multiple JSON files into a single CSV file to prepare for visualizations.

### line_graphs_viz.R

Running this will save line graphs of centeredness or cosine similarity over time. You can edit this file to specify which graphs you want (under the headers "Graphs" and "Saving graphs") and the input/output locations  (under the header "Import Data").

### bar_graphs_viz.R

Running this will save bar graphs of centeredness or cosine similarity for each collection of books. You can edit this file to specify which graphs you want (under the headers "Graphs" and "Saving graphs") and the input/output locations (under the header "Import Data").
